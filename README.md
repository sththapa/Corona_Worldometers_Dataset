# Overview
This is the dataset provided by DeepMindCreations with a aim to scrap the data from the officai site of worldometers https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries. The data is parsed in the form of table using BeautifulSoup library to parse the html dataset. Similarly, further the data are cleaned by removing some punctuations so that our data will be free from errors and later visualized with Exploratory Data Analysis (Data Visualization).
